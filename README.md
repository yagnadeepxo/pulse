## The Problem  

Millions of people worldwide face significant financial obstacles:  

- **Rampant Inflation**: In countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Syria, inflation rates exceed 100%, eroding the value of local currencies daily.  
- **Limited Access to USD**: In countries with strict currency controls (e.g., Argentina with a $200 monthly USD limit, nigeria with $20 monthly USD limit), many people rely on informal networks to obtain stable currencies.  
- **Lack of Banking Access**: Many remain unbanked or underbanked, unable to access savings accounts or debit cars
- **Volatile Local Currencies**: Workers and freelancers are paid in currencies that rapidly lose value, making it impossible to save or plan for the future.  

Pulse addresses these problems with a secure, self-custodial, and high-yield banking experience powered by the USDe stablecoin.
